# Tutorial for Matching HTML Tag Regex

For this challenge we had to create a Regex tutorial.

for my tutorial I chose to research and create my tutorial based on the Matching HTML Tag: /^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/

for my research I utilised google as much as possible along with many other tutorials that I came across. 

you can find my tutorial in the link provided below.
