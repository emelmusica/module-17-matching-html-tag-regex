# Tutorial for Matching HTML Tag

Welcome! In this guide, we will explore the /^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/ regex.

Whether you're new to regular expressions like myself or want to expand your understanding, 
this tutorial will break down each component of the regex and explain its functionality.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we'll explore the regex pattern: 
/^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)/. 
This regular expression is specifically crafted to recognize HTML tags, 
whether they are opening tags or self-closing tags. It excels at extracting 
the tag name and, where relevant, any content enclosed within those tags.

It's essential to have an understanding of HTML tags, To make the 
most of this tutorial. As a quick refresher, HTML tags are enclosed within 
< and > symbols, forming both an opening and closing "tag." If you've ever 
inspected the source code of a web page, you've likely come across examples 
like < HTML >, < main >, < div >, and many others.
