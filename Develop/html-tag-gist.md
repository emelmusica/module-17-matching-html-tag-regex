# Tutorial for Matching HTML Tag

Welcome! In this guide, we will explore the /^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/ regex.

Whether you're new to regular expressions like myself or want to expand your understanding, 
this tutorial will break down each component of the regex and explain its functionality.

## Summary

Regular expressions, often referred to as Regex, play a big role in string search algorithms. 
They are there to identify specific patterns within text, and this process is typically carried 
out using functions like FIND or FIND AND REPLACE.

To illustrate this concept, let's take a look at an example of searching for HTML tags in code:

/^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/

This regular expression is specifically crafted to recognize HTML tags, 
whether they are opening tags or self-closing tags. It excels at extracting 
the tag name and, where relevant, any content enclosed within those tags.

It's essential to have an understanding of HTML tags, To make the 
most of this tutorial. As a quick refresher, HTML tags are enclosed within 
< and > symbols, forming both an opening and closing "tag." If you've ever 
inspected the source code of a web page, you've likely come across examples 
like < HTML >, < main >, < div >, and many others.

In the world of HTML, an important rule is that for every open tag, there must 
be a corresponding closing tag. This ensures that the code within the tags functions 
as intended. HTML tags can be more complex than the previous straightforward example, 
often incorporating distinct elements that execute specific tasks when the webpage is 
rendered. Take a moment to ponder this complexity:

< a href="http://www.MusicStuffs.com" title="This is MusicStuffs" target="_blank" >

Let's start by breaking down a link with the URL "http://www.MusicStuffs.com." When you 
hover your mouse over it, you'll notice the title "This is MusicStuff" appears. Additionally, 
it has the attribute "target="_blank"," which signifies that clicking the link will open 
a new browser window or tab, depending on the user's browser settings.

Because HTML tags can have a wide spectrum of characters, a regex string search needs 
to be flexible enough to account for alphanumeric characters as well as special characters.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
In Regex, anchors such as ^ and $ define the boundaries for a match within an input string. The caret ^ marks the start of the search, and the dollar $ denotes the end, ensuring that the regex pattern matches the entire string. In the context of the HTML tag regex /^<([ a-z ]+)([ ^< ]+)(?:>(.)</\1>|\s+/>)$, the opening < and closing > tags are anchored at the beginning and end of the pattern. This allows the system to locate < and > characters along with any content in between, whether it's alphanumeric or comprised of special characters.
